Hi, can you help me to organization test cases for my typescript language library? it's need `describe` and `it` title:

import type { StoreInterface } from '@repo/core';
import { mockData, mockStore, type MockData } from '@repo/mocks';
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

describe('', () => {
{{HERE}}
});

Hi, I need help organizing test cases for my TypeScript language library using the `describe` and `it` titles. The test files includes the following imports:

-   `type StoreInterface` from `@repo/core`
-   `mockData`, `mockStore`, and `type MockData` from `@repo/mocks`
-   Test utilities `describe`, `expect`, `it`, and `vi` from `vitest`

The test cases is the following functions:
describe('', () => {
{{HERE}}
});

Please provide an organized structure for these test cases within `describe` blocks for each test function, including relevant `it` titles and assertions. Thank you!
